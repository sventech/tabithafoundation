_empowering family_


### Vision

We promote and invest in the wellbeing of our most disadvantaged and vulnerable families by empowering women and children; transforming our community through holistic education, agriculture and social development. 

### Work

We operate a farm and a nursery school. Our goal is for the proceeds of the farm to fund the school and further help support the students all the way to university. In the nearer term we provide families with agricultural training and work opportunities.
